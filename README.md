## **Architecture**

The Minorio Members repository is structured to guide contributors through their first GitHub pull request. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### **Repository Structure**
```
minorio-members/
â”œâ”€â”€ members/               # Directory containing all member profiles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ template.md        # Template for new members
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ your-github-username.md # Example member profile
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/               # GitHub-specific configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/         # GitHub Actions workflows
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ validate-member.yml # Validates member files for correctness
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Instructions for contributors
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html             # Landing page for the GitHub Pages site
â””â”€â”€ _config.yml            # Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages
```

### **Key Components**
1. **GitHub Pages**:
   - The site is deployed at [Minorio Members GitHub Pages](https://minorio-core.github.io/minorio-members/).
   - Displays the list of approved community members.

2. **Member Profiles**:
   - Stored as Markdown files in the `members/` directory.
   - Each file includes structured data (YAML front matter) to describe the member.

3. **Automation**:
   - A GitHub Action validates all member profile submissions for correctness using the `validate-member.yml` workflow.
   - This ensures consistent formatting and prevents errors.

4. **Dynamic Member List**:
   - Jekyll processes the Markdown files and dynamically renders them on the GitHub Pages site.
   - Contributors see their profiles added automatically upon merging their pull requests.

---

## **Our Community Members**
Once your pull request is approved and merged, your profile will be displayed on the [Minorio Members site](https://minorio-core.github.io/minorio-members/).

---

### **Contributing Guidelines**
- Ensure your file is placed in the `members` directory.
- Use the [template](members/template.md) to format your profile correctly.
- Keep your YAML syntax valid (e.g., use square brackets for lists).
